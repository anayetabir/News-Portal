1..Difference between local Storage and Session Storage?

LocalStorage:
Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site​
sessionStorage:
It is similar to localStorage.
Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted
The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.

2..What is the difference between global and local scope?

Global Scope:
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

Local Scope:
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.Local variables have Function Scope:
They can only be accessed from within the function.
