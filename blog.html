    <!-- Question-1  -->
    <h1>1..Difference between local Storage and Session Storage?</h1>
    <p>LocalStorage:
        Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
        Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
        The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing
        the amount of traffic between client and server.
        The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all
        current and future visits to the site​.
        <br>
        sessionStorage:
        It is similar to localStorage.Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and
        Firefox). Changes made are saved and
        available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window
        isclosed, the storage is deleted.
        The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.

    <!-- Question-2 -->
    <h1>2..What is the difference between global and local scope?</h1>
    <p>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.Global variables can be accessed from
        anywhere in a JavaScript program.Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared
        outside a block.

        Local Scope:
        Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.Local variables have Function
        Scope:
        They can only be accessed from within the function.

    <h1>3..How does js event loop work?</h1>
    <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single
        thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at
        what happens on the back-end.The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be
        executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.The event queue is responsible for
        sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct
        sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.Whenever an async function is called, it is sent
        to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the
        API starts its own single-threaded operation.An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout
        operation is processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to
        send this operation back in for processing.Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a
        cyclic system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the
        browser APIs act as separate threads.The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or
        not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then
        the current function call is processed.</p>

    <!-- Question-4 -->
    <h1>4..How many ways to find undefined?</h1>
    <p>The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive
        types.undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value
        of undefined is the primitive value undefined.In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable,
        non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)A variable that has not been
        assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
        being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>

1..Difference between local Storage and Session Storage?

LocalStorage:
Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site​
sessionStorage:
It is similar to localStorage.
Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted
The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.

2..What is the difference between global and local scope?

Global Scope:
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

Local Scope:
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.Local variables have Function Scope:
They can only be accessed from within the function.
